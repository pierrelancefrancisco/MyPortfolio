        <h1 class="card__name">College Life</h1>
        <p>Had a rough start on college due to it starting on the rise of the pandemic. Everybody was adjusting to the new setup for virtual learning.
          The first few subjects that I truly enjoyed were 
          programming subjects since I believe that I can sit and stare at my computer for 10 hours a day. I'm thankful for DLS-CSB for
          giving me an opportunity to learn my course properly with the correct professors. I didn't have any troubles finding

          <span class="card__read-more">friends
            during my college years. All of the people that I've encountered are friendly, helpful and caring.
            I did not focus on minor subjects that much because all that mattered for me was learning how to write codes 
            properly. Overall my college experience had taught me a lot and I believe that I've improved than my past self.

        <h1 class="card__name">Career Goals</h1>
        <p>I want to graduate on time and become a C# developer to master this language. I've liked C# more Java due to it having more 
          shortcuts based on the IDE that I was using. I first wanted to become a full stack developer because it sounded cool to know everything,
          but upon my research on becoming a fullstack developer there were a lot to learn so I wanted to become a back end developer first. I wanted to 
          become better in C# first before trying out other programming languages because

          <span class="card__read-more">I believe that once I've mastered the foundations it would be
            easier for me to switch languages on the fly. In the future, I want to become an intern on either Infor or Finastra. I've heard a lot on those
            two companies and I hope to get a position there. As years pass my goal is to have a senior position after 7 years on the 
            company that I'm working at.

        <h1 class="card__name">Next Steps</h1>
        <p>After achieving my career goals, the next step is to keep on improving to code. I want to develop a game and publish it on steam with me being
          the only person that worked on the back-end side. It is fun to explore new areas of programming and as much as I love playing video games, I 
          want to try and create a game for people to enjoy and play. 

          <span class="card__read-more">Then another step would be to create a business here in the Philippines or in other countries
            . Businesses may be a key to one's future retirement plan to live off with.

        <h1 class="card__name">Internship learning</h1>
        <p> I was a QA Intern on Infomaninc, there were a lot of tasks that was given to me during my time. I've learned a lot from testing applications
          and being cooperative to my supervisor and the programming team. We had to document and modify SRFs or Service Request Forms accordingly to the
          given instructions. I had a hard time editing SRF's since there were different versions of the file and there were miscommunications between the
          QA and Programming team. I've also learned what else to test on systems due to my supervisor giving us tips on what to expect and find. I did not  

          <span class="card__read-more">expect that we had to read a lot of documents before testing the application. Being an OJT here also developed my personal skills such as socializing with our higher ups, learning to sleep
            while commuting and being persevering during this time since I always had less than 8 hours of sleep. This experience has prepared for my
            future work/career life.
