        <h1 class="card__name">College Life</h1>
        <p>Had a rough start on college due to it starting on the rise of the pandemic. Everybody were adjusting to the new setup for virtual learning.
          The first few subjects that I truly enjoyed were 
          programming subjects since I believe that I can sit and stare at my computer for 10 hours a day. I'm thankful for DLS-CSB for
          giving me an opportunity to learn my course properly with the correct professors. I didn't have any troubles finding

          <span class="card__read-more">friends
            during my college years. All of the people that I've encountered are friendly, helpful and caring.
            I did not focus on minor subjects that much because all that mattered for me was learning how to write codes 
            properly. Overall my college experience had taught me a lot and I believe that I've improved than my past self.

        <h1 class="card__name">Career Goals</h1>
        <p>I want to graduate on time and become a C# developer to master this language. I've liked C# more Java due to it having more 
          shortcuts based on the IDE that I was using. I first wanted to become a full stack developer because it sounded cool to know everything,
          but upon my research on becoming a fullstack developer there were a lot to learn so I wanted to become a back end developer first. I wanted to 
          become better in C# first before trying out other programming languages because

          <span class="card__read-more">I believe that once I've mastered the foundations it would be
            easier for me to switch languages on the fly. In the future, I want to become an intern on either Infor or Finastra. I've heard a lot on those
            two companies and I hope to get a position there. As years pass my goal is to have a senior position after 7 years on the 
            company that I'm working at.

        <h1 class="card__name">Next Steps</h1>
        <p>After achieving my career goals, the next step is to keep on improving to code. I want to develop a game and publish it on steam with me being
          the only person that worked on the back-end side. It is fun to explore new areas of programming and as much as I love playing video games, I 
          want to try and create a game for people to enjoy and play. 

          <span class="card__read-more">Then another step would be to create a business here in the Philippines or in other countries
            . Businesses may be a key to one's future retirement plan to live off with.
